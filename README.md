Create a script, in Python, that uses Jenkins' API to get a list of jobs and their status from a given Jenkins instance. The status for each job should be stored in a sqlite database along with the time for when it was checked.


Note:
To access the DB you will require login credentials which I will supply via the email.

Thank you.
